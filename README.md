### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a software engineer passionate about turning big ideas into lean, scalable, and impactful solutions. With almost 5 years of experience, I’ve helped build and scale ed-tech platforms used across multiple countries — from pre-seed to post-Series A.

I focus on:
- 🧠 **First-principles thinking** — building what actually matters
- ⚡ **Performance** — optimizing systems for real-world scale
- 🌐 **DX** — creating tools and experiences devs love
